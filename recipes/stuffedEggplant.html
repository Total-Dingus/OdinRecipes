    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F

        <li>Cut around the edge of the flesh in each eggplant half using a sharp paring knife,<br>
            leaving a 1/2-inch border. Scoop out flesh using a spoon, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell; 
            reserve flesh and chop into bite-size pieces. </li>
        <li>Brush shells with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season 
            with salt and pepper; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, 
            deep skillet over medium high heat.<br> Add sausage, onion, mushrooms, and garlic; 
            cook and stir until sausage is evenly brown. <br>
            Stir in reserved chopped eggplant and basil. Add pasta sauce; 
            cook and stir for 5 minutes. Mix in 1/2 cup of panko and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. </li>
        <li>Stuff mixture into eggplant shells. Combine remaining panko and cheese in a small bowl; sprinkle over stuffing. </li>          
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until eggplant is tender, 45 to 50 minutes. </li>
