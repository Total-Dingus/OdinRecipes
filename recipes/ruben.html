    <p><h2>Description:</h2></p>
    <p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. <br>
       The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, <br>
       but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese. 
    </p>
    <p>A traditional reuben sandwich consists of thinly sliced corned beef, Swiss cheese, <br>
       and sauerkraut on rye bread slathered with Russian or Thousand Island dressing.
